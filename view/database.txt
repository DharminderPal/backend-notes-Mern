database---->>are stucutred systems for storing , manging and retreiving data efficiently

catagorized based  on how they store the data1

1. relational (sql database)
2 Non-relational(nosql,database)

Relational dbs  the data in form  of tables (rows and colums) each tables represemt am emitiy 
(user,product , orders , review) which is related in terms of strucuture.


non relational dbs store the data in form of json like formats(bson ) each document is independant and 
can be changed as per usage there is no  strict schema at the database level

this poses security issus --> for that we ues data modeling on the server level.
