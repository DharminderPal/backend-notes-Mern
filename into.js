https protocol --- >> internet protocol used for communication in the appliaction layer of networking  

Http Methods--->> request -> purpose in terms of data -->get ,post ,put ,patch ,delete

restful api -->> Reprasetational satete transfer -> this is an api development architecture thah follows some priciples that help 
us to rcreate a scalable flxible and efficient web server for communitcation between  cleint and data 

architecture pointers
1. unifirms interface----> well identification of resorces  -> /api /asignup /
2. staetlessness ->>>> we dnot store any data on the server.
3. cacheability -->> the server should be able to respone for better performance ... and reduce latency ..
4. layered system -->>   we implemnt feautres in layers .


http status codes  
they tell about the nature  of the response that we have got 

200 -->ok
400 ---> client errors 
500 server errors 

react -> framwork that is used for ceating dynamic uis and front ends.
node.js --> javascript runtime that allows us to run javascript on the server side , enabling 
non blocking i/o operations for building scalable network applications.
